# Data::MuForm - validator and HTML form processor using Moo

Data::MuForm is a data validation and form handling package written in Moo.
It is a conversion of HTML::FormHandler to Moo. The core behavior is the same,
but things have been regularized, simplified, renamed, and in some cases re-written.
Rendering is substantially changed.

A MuForm 'validator' or 'form' is a Perl subclass of L<Data::MuForm>. In your
class you define fields and validators. Because it's a Perl class written with
Moo, you have a lot of flexibility and control.

Data::MuForm will loaded into CPAN evenutually.
