# ABSTRACT: MuForm manual

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Data::MuForm manual.

Data::MuForm performs validation and is a framework for processing
forms.

One of the main goals of MuForm is flexibility. There are many customizable
methods and transforms, and a number of official hooks for changing class behavior.
In addition, since MuForm is written in Moo, you can override almost everything.

You can split the pieces of your forms up into logical parts and compose
complete forms from MuForm classes, roles, fields, collections of
validations, transformations and type constraints.
You can write custom methods to process forms, add any attribute you like,
and use method modifiers.  MuForm validators/forms are Perl classes, so there's
a lot of flexibility in what you can do.
